# 🚲 Bike Price Prediction – Data Science Project 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Bike Price Prediction system using Data Science and Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to predict the resale price of bikes based on multiple features such as bike brand, model, year, kilometers driven, fuel type, owner type, and other relevant attributes. This helps users and sellers make data-driven pricing decisions.

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains historical bike sales data with both numerical and categorical features, including:

Bike Name / Brand

Year of Manufacture

Kilometers Driven

Fuel Type

Seller Type

Owner Type

Selling Price (Target Variable)

The dataset required proper cleaning and preprocessing before model building.

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

The following preprocessing steps were performed:

Handling missing and inconsistent values

Removing irrelevant or duplicate records

Encoding categorical variables using Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding

Feature selection to remove unnecessary columns

Scaling numerical features where required

This ensured the data was clean and suitable for machine learning models.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to understand data patterns and relationships:

Distribution analysis of bike prices

Relationship between price and year, kilometers driven, and owner type

Correlation analysis to identify important features

Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

EDA helped identify key factors affecting bike prices.

## 🤖 Model Building

Multiple regression-based machine learning models were trained and evaluated, such as:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor (if used)

The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and models were evaluated using metrics like:

R² Score

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

The best-performing model was selected based on accuracy and generalization performance.

## 📈 Model Evaluation & Results

The selected model achieved good prediction accuracy on unseen test data

Feature importance analysis showed that bike age, kilometers driven, and brand significantly impact resale price

The model can predict realistic price ranges for used bikes
